## üëã Hello! My name is Matt and I build apps for people

Every project I have finished was because I had someone I was specifically building it for. Making things that other people appreciate is what drives me to be a better developer.

### Check out my projects!
 - **[Cooped-Up](https://github.com/mattwells19/Cooped-Up)**: A web-based version of the game Coup. I have a friend group that loves board games including Coup. During lockdown we played games online, but there wasn't a good version of Coup that we could fine. So I built one, and this is it.
 - **[UNCC-SIX-MANS](https://github.com/ClamSageCaleb/UNCC-SIX-MANS)**: A Discord Bot I helped build for managing pickup games in Rocket League for the UNCC Rocket League community. It even has its own leaderboard!
 - **[Wells Front Desk](https://github.com/mattwells19/Wells-Front-Desk)**: My first full-stack project on my own. A lot of bad code, but I learned a TON while working on this. Not something I recommend using, but something I'm still proud of.
 - There are even more projects I've worked on that I don't have listed here that you can check out as well if you're interested.
