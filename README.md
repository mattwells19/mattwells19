## üëã Hello! My name is Matt and I build apps for people

Every project I have finished was because I had someone I was specifically building it for. Making things that other people appreciate is what drives me to be a better developer.

### Check out my projects!
 - **[Cooped Up](https://github.com/mattwells19/Cooped-Up)**: A web-based version of the game Coup. I have a friend group that loves board games including Coup. During lockdown we played games online, but there wasn't a good version of Coup that we could fine. So I built one, and this is it.
 - **[Love Pebble](https://github.com/mattwells19/LovePebble)**: A web-based, 6-player version of the popular board game Love Letter! Used this project to play with Deno 2 and React 19 when both were released.
 - **[CATCh Website](https://github.com/mattwells19/CATCh)**: The official website for the Comedy Arts Theater of Charlotte!
 - **[Devs Playing Poker](https://github.com/mattwells19/DevsPlayingPoker)**: A simple and fast tool to help your scrum team effort tickets as quickly as possible. Built as part of the Innovation Project competition at Endava.
 - There are even more projects I've worked on that I don't have listed here that you can check out as well if you're interested.
